Building a Virtual Macine for Programming Language

Course by Dmitry Soshnikov

Some context on interpretation is a prerequisite:
- Closures
- Scope chain
- Identifier resolution
- Environment

Notes from the previous course "Building an Interpreter from scratch":

# Section 1: VM basic operations

Lecture 1: Introduction to Virtual Machines

Recap:
- Compilers don't execute anything, they just translate from one
    language to another (hoping that there is an interpreter for the
    target language - that in the lowest level, is the CPU itself)
- To get the output of some program, "WE ALWAYS NEED AN INTERPRETER"
    - If there is no interpreter for the language, we need a compiler 
        that translate the code for another language that have one

- AST interpreter
    - "Defines the high-level semantics"
    - Pipeline
    --------- Static time (compile time) (before code execution)
    Program `print "hello"` ->
    Tokenizer (lexical analysis) ->
    Tokens `[ID: "print"] [STRING: "hello"]` ->
    Parser (syntatic analysis) ->
    AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) (intermediate representation) ->
    --------- Runtime (actual code execution)
    Interpreter (runtime semantics) ->
    Result "hello"
    


Bytecode interpreter: aks virtual machine
Couple of more extra steps during the compilation and fundamentally
changes the runtime data sctructures

--------- Static time (compile time) (before code execution)
Program `print "hello"` ->
Tokenizer (lexical analysis) ->
Tokens ->
Parser (syntatic analysis) ->
AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) ->
-- Extra step:
Bytecode Emitter (a compiler) ->
Bytecode
    ```
    // example:
    push "hello"
    call print
    ``` ->
--
Interpreter ->
Result "hello"

Why bytecode instead of AST:
* AST takes more space and can be slower in the evaluation loop
* bytecode is just array of bytes, which is much faster to interpret and
    takes less space


Example:
```
// Source code
(begin
    (var x 15)
    (- (+ x 10) 5))

// AST
// Too much memory
// Everything is at runtime
// Slow eval
["begin",
    ["var", "x", 15],
    ["-", ["x", x, 10], 5]]

// Bytecode
// Lower memory
// Pre-compile as much as possible
// Fast eval
01 00 0A 03 09 03 01 01
02 01 02 03 00
```

* "Instead of evaluating if variable x is in the environment chain,
we know exactly in which environment it exists and know exactly the index
in that environment, so the evaluation becomes much faster"

* Compilation optimizations before we hit the runtime

** This representation becomes much harder to read from humans, so:
// Disassembly
0000   01 00   CONST        0 (15)
0002   0A 00   SET_GLOBAL   0 (x)
0004   09 00   GET_GLOBAL   0 (x)
0006   01 01   CONST        1 (10)
0008   02      ADD
0009   01 02   CONST        2 (5)
000B   03      SUB
000C   00      HALT


[Memory adress where bytecode is located]
[bytecode itself]
[textual representation, known as the assembly]
[??? don't know what are the last 2]

**** "In this class WE USE CUSTOM BYTECODE, that we invented"
        it will looks very similar to the python bytecode



We will implement the language "Eva" again,
same as the previous course


** We will be using just header files with direct implementations
    *** not the best thing to do in C++ (usually split declaration in
        the header and implementation in .cpp), but, again, this course
        is not about cpp

Note about cpp:
```c++
// EvaVM.h
#ifndef __EvaVM_h
#define __EvaVM_h

#endif
```
- this "preprocessor directives" ensure that the contents of "EvaVM.h"
    header file are only included once in a source file. If the header
    is included multiple times in the samne source file or in different
    source files, this technique helps prevent duplication and potential
    compilation errors
- `#ifndef` stands for the obvious "if not defined", that checks if a
    macro with the name `__EvaVM_h` has not been defined before in the
    code. If it has not, it will execute the code withing the following
    `#endif` block
- `#define` defines a macro named `__EvaVM_h`. When this line is
    encountered, it effectively "marks" the macro as defined

- ...the whole point is just make sure the header is included only once




ip = instruction pointer = (aka) pc = program counter
** called ip, for example, in the Intel architecture

in contrast with the AST interpreter, the eval function,
heart of any interpreter, is NOT recursive here: it is an infinite loop

the set of the bytecode instructions is knonw as the instructions set



Note about cpp:
```bash
// Check installed version
clang++ -v

// Compile enabeling warnings and debugging support
clang++ -std=c++17 -Wall -ggdb3 ./eva-vm.cpp -out ./eva-vm
```



Lecture 2: Stack-based vs. Register-based VMs

Virtual machines:
- Stack-based machines
    - Stack for operands and operators
    - Result is always on top of the stack
- Register-based machines
    - Set of virtual registers
        - In physic machines is located directly in the CPU,
            in VMs is just storage for variables
    - Result is in "accumulator" register (example `eax` in Intel arch)
    - Mapped to real via register allocation

** Details also in notes from previous course (always good to revisit)


Stack-based machines

```
// Source code
x = 15;
x + 10 - 5;
```

```
// Bytecode
push $15
set %0
push %0
push $10
add
push $5
sub
```

There are 2 "control structures": the stack itself and a Var storage
Step by step:

- push $15
push `15` to the top of the stack

- set %0
set index 0 of the Var storage as the value in the top of the stack
```
// Var storage
%0 = 15
```

- push %0
push the value at index %0 in the Var storage to the top of the stack

- push $10
push `10` to the top of the stack

- add
gets the 2 items in the stack and add them; puts the result in the top

- push $5
`5` to the top

- sub
same as add, but subtract

* result should be on the top of the stack (the value `sub` pushed)


during the execution of bytecode, there is the ip (instruction pointer)
and stack pointer, that move accordingly to the next instruction and
points to the top of the stack


"many VMs have the concept of Constant pool"
- array of constants
- example in this bytecode example (constants used here)
    ```
    // Constant pull
    %0 = 15
    %1 = 10
    %2 = 5
    ```
- Some VMs may prefer using the constants directly
- For simple numbers may not have any difference, however may have
    for strings (that are objects already allocated on the heap and we
    may want to reuse the same constant string by just using the index,
    instead of enconding the string directly in the bytecode)

```
// Eva bytecode
CONST 0            // Use the index 0 from Constant pull
SET_GLOBAL 0       // Set index 0 from Var storage with the value in top
GET_GLOBAL 0       // Push index 0 from Var storage to top
CONST 1            // Use index 1 from Constant pull (push top of stack)
ADD
CONST 2            // Same... index 2 to top of the stack
SUB
HALT               // END of execution
```

**** Eva VM will be stack-based

Notable examples of stack-based are: Java, Python, Javascript ...

** Compiler explorer tool: godblot.org, for exploring the bytecode
generated for stack machine in another languages



Register-based machines

```
/* Registers */

// General purpouse
r1 = 0
r2 = 0
r3 = 0
r4 = 0

// Special registers
ip = 0                /* Instruction pointer */
sp = 0                /* Stack pointer */
bp = 0                /* Base pointer */
```

In most of the cases, VMs and real machines are of MIXED type
(a register-machine which also has a stack), like Intel arch

Stack pointer and base pointer may be needed to
implement recursive calls


```
// Bytecode
mov r1, $15,
add r1, $10
sub r1, $5
```

Bytecode instructions are executed while the instruction pointer
is updated (increased)

Finally, after execution, the result is in register r1

Notable examlpes: Lua virtual machine, the Perl VM ...



Lecture 3: Logger implementation

Just adding simple logs and error handling



Lecture 4: Numbers | Introduction to Stack

1. new operation code OP_CONST 0x01 (push a constant onto the stack)

** we don't use the actual number to push on the stack, like:
    `OP_CONST 42`, instead, we use the index of the number in the 
    "constant pool": `OP_CONST 0`, `%0 = 42`

2. EvaValue.h
    - Enum EvaValueType for the types of values we will use
    - struct EvaValue as tagged union (in addition to the value itself,
        we are going to store its type)
        ```c++
        EvaValueType type;
        union {
            double number;
        }
        ```
        - "virtual machines usually represent values as typed-values"
        - [x] Take a look on `union`, but it seems that, when define
            another values, like `bool boolean`, i "assign" one of them
            and it ocupates the same size, diff from like a struct,
            that have multiple fields

    - Constructor macro for NUMBER: EvaValueType will be number and
        the field number is set to the passed value

3. Declare the constant pool property (the size of it will be an 
    EvaValue) and it will be dynamic (vector, not array)
    - [ ] take a better look on vector (confirm is a heap thing)

4. Initialize the constant pool (manually by now, with a single value)
    - constants.push_back(...);
    - note that constants is a vector of type EvaValue

5. Handle the Operation Code for CONST in the evaluation `void eval()`
    - get the value from the constant pool and push to the stack
    - note that the index of the value in the constant pool will be
        the next instruction in the code (we can use READ_BYTE macro)
    - may create a macro for GET_CONST()
        - racap: this macro is a text substitution in compile time
        ```c++
        #define GET_CONST() constants[READ_BYTE()]
        ```
        note: `READ_BYTE()` will return the VALUE pointed the the
        instruction pointer (ip) (then it will move the ip for the
        next position). So in a instruction like that: OP_CONST 0,
        READ_BYTE() would return the index of the constant.
        That's why we use `constants[]`, cause we ACCESS THE INDEX
        OF THE CONSTANT (and this is how our bytecode works)

6. Declare the stack and the stack pointer
    - The stack has a fixed size (use an array, instead of vector)
    - Create a macro for the STACK_LIMIT with 512 values
    - The type of the stack is EvaValues
        - note that we are doing `constants.push_back(NUMBER(42))`,
        so constant pool will contain EvaValues (that's its type)
    - Create the stack pointer: `EvaValue* sp`


7. Create push operation, to push a value in the top of the stack
    - Needs to check if its possible to push on the stack (if it's
        full, that's a Stack Overflow error)

8. Create pop operator, to remove the top element of the stack
    - Decrease the stack pointer and return the new value
    - Also check for an empty stack and return an error for this case
        `DIE << "pop(): empty stack.\n";
        check empty stack with `sp == stack.begin()`

        *** this will work, but `stack.size() == 0` will not,
        because we have a pre-allocated array, so the size will
        never be 0.

        *** note: push increments the stack pointer, so:
        // push(NUMBER(100));
        100
            <- sp (not pointing to 100, but the next position, that
                   would be empty)
        so, pop needs first to decrease the stack pointer to
        finally return the value. A `pop()` in this example would
        return `100` (cause it's where the stack pointer is pointing to)

        that's also why we need to check for the empty stack.

9. Return EvaValue from eval and exec functions

10. Update the check for OP_HALT (end of bytecode instructions),
    to pop() the stack and return
    ```c++
    // Return the value on top of stack (since is stack-base VM,
    // the result is always let on top) and ****clean it
    return pop();
    ```
11. Create accessor macro AS_NUMBER to return the EvaValue as
    C++ implementation `((double)(evaValue).number)`

12. Update the main function at `eva-vm.cpp` to log the EvaValue response



Lecture 5: Math binary operations

Implementation of the mathematical operations.

1. Include the new "operation codes" in OpCode.h
    - Add instruction: OP_ADD

2. Uptade the eval method to handle OP_ADD operation code
    - Expects 2 operands in the top of the stack
    - Pop first 2 operands in top of the stack, perform the addition
      and push the result back to the stack

      To perform the addition, we need to have doubles instead of
      EvaValues, so we can simply use the AS_NUMBER accessor we created
      on previous lecture.

    - Note: remember (by now) manually push back the values in the
      constant pool and modify the `code` at `exec` function

3. Define all other math operations (OpCode.h):
    - Subtraction: OP_SUB
    - Multiplaction: OP_MULT
    - Division: OP_DIV
    ** Note: Don't forget to modify the value of each macro
       (sequentially increase the hex value)

4. Create BINARY_OP macro, that will perform the same as addition
    - This way, we can reuse the same implementation of a base binary
      operation for all operands:
      *** Multiple line macros: `\ do {} while (false)`
      ```c++
      #define BINARY_OP(op) \
        do { \
            auto op2 = AS_NUMBER(pop()); \
            auto op1 = AS_NUMBER(pop()); \
            push(NUMBER(op1 op op2)); \
        } while (false)
      ```

      **** NOTE: we retrieve the operands in order to execute then
      "first in, last output", op2 will be the last defined, so we can
      perform:
      ```
      constants.push_back(10);
      constnats.push_back(3);

      // OP_SUB
      op2 = 3
      op1 = 10
      op1 - op2 = 7
      ```
      instead of:
      ```
      // OP_SUB
      op1 = 3
      op2 = 10
      op1 - op2 = -7
      ```

5. Handle all other operations in eval function

6. Make some tests

NOTE: debugger:
``` bash
lldb ./eva-vm
```

(b -> break)
"break in the eval function": `b eval`

(r -> run)
just press `r` to start running and
`n` to go step by step

(p -> peak)
"we can instrospect what is in the top of the stack": `p stack[0]`



Lecutre 6: Strings | Introduction to Heap and Objects

This is about implementing string type, our first object type.

"in constrast with the symbol number, we can't encode the string
directly inside the EvaValue (inside the union)"
- The strings will be allocated on the heap and inside the EvaValue,
    we will be storing the reference (the pointer) to the heap allocated
    string

1. Introduce "generic object pointer type" and OBJECT EvaValueType
    - EvaValueType now may be either NUMBER or OBJECT type
    - Now EvaValue must have the Object object reference inside the
        union declaration
        ```c++
        struct EvaValue {
            EvaValueType type;
            union {
                double number;
                Object* object;
            };
        };
        ```
    - Create the ObjectType enum (we may have multiple types of objects,
        the first one will be STRING)
    - Create the Object struct (that `Object*` is OUR custom type)
        ```c++
        // Base object.
        struct Object {
            // Constructor
            Object(ObjectType type) : type(type) {}
            ObjectType type;
        };
    - Create the StringObject (inherit from the Object) 
        ```c++
        struct StringObject : public Object {
            StringObject(const std::string &str) 
                : Object(ObjectType::STRING), string(str) {}
            std::string string;
        }
        ```
    - Create the ALLOC_STRING constructor macro
        - Note: we use the "ALLOC" prefix to anything that allocates
            objects on the heap, so we understand that potentially we
            need to garbage collect (later topic on the course)
        ```c++
        #define ALLOC_STRING(value) \
            ((EvaValue){EvaValueType::OBJECT, \
                .object = (Object*)new StringObject(value)})

    - Create the AS_STRING accessor:
        ```c++
        #define AS_STRING(evaValue) ((StringObject*)(evaValue).object)
        ```
    - Also the AS_CPPSTRING accessor, for convenience:
        ```c++
        #define AS_CPPSTRING(evaValue) (AS_STRING(evaValue)->string)
        ```

2. Modify the EvaVM.h exec method to test the STRING constant type
    *** Now a note about a why we are using the constant pool:
    constants.push_back(ALLOC_STRING("Hello")) allocates the string
    only once, and we can use the same index at the pool to access this
    value multiple times (if the same value is refered multiple times),
    that saves a lot of spaces

    - Push a string to the constant pool
        `constants.push_back(ALLOC_STRING("Hello"))`
    - Rewrite the code (program instructions, that is a fixed array now)
        `code = {OP_CONST, 0, OP_HALT}`
    - Update the eva-vm.cpp main function to log the result of the
        execution as string using the AS_CPPSTRING accessor

3. Modify the exec method to test string concatenation
    ```c++
    constants.push_back(ALLOC_STRING("Hello, ");
    constants.push_back(ALLOC_STRING("world!");

    // Eva: (+ "Hello, " "world!") -> "Hello, world!"
    code = {OP_CONST, 0, OP_CONST, 1, OP_ADD, OP_HALT}
    ```

4. Update OP_ADD to consider STRINGS (currently works only for NUMBERS)
    - Instead of using BINARY_OP, get op2 and op1 directly in the eval
        method and check if both operands are NUMBERs (IS_NUMBER).

        If true, cast both op1 and op2 as number (AS_NUMBER) and
        execute the addition and push the result as NUMBER EvaValue
        type (just the way already is)

        Also check is both operands are strings (else if).
        If true, cast the operands as STRING (AS_STRING) and perform
        the string concat using the same + C++ operand, then
        push the result on the stack as STRING:
        ```c++
        push(ALLOC_STRING(s1 + s1));
        ```

        ALLOC_STRING returns a EvaValue, but allocates an Object on the
        Heap (that is the Object* object; under the union).

        Since the EvaValue will be storing the REFERENCE to the object
        and not the object itself (as happens with NUMBER), once this
        value is popped from the stack, the value will still exist
        on the heap. THIS IS A MEMORY LEAK.

        Later in the course this will be fixed (gargabe collection 
        section).

5. Introduce this 2 testers IS_NUMBER and IS_STRING at EvaValue.h
    ```c++
    #define IS_NUMBER(evaValue) ((evaValue).type == EvaValueType::NUMBER)
    #define IS_OBJECT(evaValue) ((evaValue).type == EvaValueType::OBJECT)

    #define IS_OBJECT_TYPE(evaValue, objectType) \
        (IS_OBJECT(evaValue) && AS_OBJECT(evaValue)->type == objectType)

    #define IS_STRING(evaValue) \
        (IS_OBJECT_TYPE(evaValue, OjectType::STRING))

6. Introduce the AS_OBJECT accessor
    ```c++
    #define AS_OBJECT(evaValue) ((Object*)(evaValue).object)
    ```

Now with objects, it's also possible to implement other values, such
as functions, closures cells etc.


Steps to reproduce:
1. Introduce "generic object pointer type" and OBJECT EvaValueType
2. Modify the EvaVM.h exec method to test the STRING constant type
3. Modify the exec method to test string concatenation
4. Update OP_ADD to consider STRINGS (currently works only for NUMBERS)
5. Introduce this 2 testers IS_NUMBER and IS_STRING at EvaValue.h
6. Introduce the AS_OBJECT accessor



Lecutre 7: Syntax | Parser implementation

Since the focus of the course is not parsing, we will use automated
parser built by the syntax tool, same as used in the previous course:

```bash
npm install -g syntax-cli
```

"syntax is the language agnostic parser generator, which means we can
write the grammar once and and then generate automatically parsers for
many target languages"

Assignment:
- [ ] Include double numbers (`3.14`) in the syntax grammar (`/src/parser/EvaGrammar.bnf` (currently it supports only integers)


Steps:
0. Make sure syntax-cli is installed
1. Create the `parser` directory and EvaGrammar.bnf inside it and declare the
    grammar (since is not the course focus, there is a lot a things I
    don't fully understand about this file yet)
2. Generate the EvaParser.h file (command is commented in the EvaGrammar file)
    - Make sure everything is corret on the .bnf file (i had some errors on
        the EvaParser.h for not having `;`, for example)
3. Modify the EvaVM.h to use the parser
    - Import the EvaParser header and use the syntax::EvaParser namespace
    - Create a parser property as a unique_ptr
    - Initialize the parser in EvaVM constructor:
        ```c++
        EvaVM() : parser(std::make_unique<EvaParser>()) {} 
        ```
    - Update `exec` method to use the parser:
        ```c++
        // Note: we receive the "read only" reference to the program string
        EvaValue exec(const std::string& program) {
            auto ast = parser->parse(program);

            ...
        }
        ```
4. Make some tests with debugging
    - `lldb ./eva-vm`
    - `b exec` (set a break in exec method)
    - `r` start running
    - `n` move next
    - `p program` and `p ast` to peak its values during debug process



Lecture 8: Compiler | Bytecode

Previous lecture was about producing the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) from
the source program, and this one is about compiling the AST to produce
the bytecode and the associated structures, such as pushing the constants
to the Constant Pool.

1. Create an instance of the Eva compiler
    - Declare the property also as an unique_ptr, now of type EvaCompiler
    - Add the initialization in the constructor, also with make_unique

    ** Recap: unique pointer make the pointer be destroyed when the
    EvaVM instance is out of scope

2. Create EvaCompiler.h and EvaCompiler class
    - Main compile API method will be the `compile` that will return a
        CodeObject pointer

        receive const Exp& as a parameter

    - Move both `std::vector<uint8_t> code;` (which is the bytecode) 
    and `std::vector<EvaValue> constants;` (constant pool) from the
    virtual machine instance to the compiler instance

    - Create field `CodeObject* co` in our class. We will be using this
    property to directly store the generated bytecode in it
        - Allocate code object
            IMPLEMENT MACROS:
            2.1 ALLOC_CODE
            2.2 AS_CODE
            2.3 IS_CODE

    ** The compiler is recursive

    2.4 Create the `gen` method, which is the main compile loop, that will
        go recursively generates the subparts. This method receive the
        const reference to a Exp expression
            - Check the expression type (NUMBER, STRING, SYMBOL, LIST as
                we defined in the Backus-Naur Form - .bnf file)
                
                NUMBER:
                a number is encoded as the constant with the index from the
                constant pool

                    - allocate the constant in the constant pool
                    - and emmit the OP_CONST op code with the exactly
                        index of the constant in the constant pool
                    ** Remark: this is the compilation of AST -> Bytecode,
                        so we need to generate the Bytecode as we are already
                        using hard-coded in the virtual machine (EvaVM)

            - Introduce the `emit` function (private), that emits data
                to the bytecode (co property)
                ```c++
                void emit(uint8_t) { co->code.push_back(code) }
                // Code is a field of the CodeObject struct
                ```


3. Update EvaValue
    - Include CODE as an ObjectType
    - Create CodeObject struct (inherit from Object)
        - name (string), constant pool and bytecode (from EvaVM)
        - create a constructor for initialize the name


**** this lecture has to much things to implement, i jsut went directly to
the code part (so the notes are incomplete)


*** behind the scene, we treat the top level code as a function, that is
the `main` function. In case of Eva language, there is no need to declare
the main function (as is in C++, Java etc), but we handle the execution this
way. So for the programmer (language user), it looks like just a script.


*** about the way we use the constant pool:
during the compilation to bytecode, before generate a OP_CONST (e.g. for
NUMBER or STRING values) we:
    1. Iterate trhough the constant pool looking for the correspondent
        value (1st check for values of the same type - STRING or NUMBER -
        then, if the value is the same, return tie index of this value,
        instead of allocating more memory the same memory again)
    2. If the value is not in the pool already, then we push_back the value
        (last position)

    ** Constant pool is allocated on the heap and managed by the
    std::vector (is of type EvaValue)




Lecture 9: Complex expressions

Now we will handle LISTS such as `(+ 1 (+ 40 1))`
